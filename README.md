## 🚀 About Me
I’m an AI & platform-focused Product Manager with 9+ years of experience shipping B2B and B2C products across fintech, eCommerce, and healthcare. I specialize in scaling systems from 0 → 1, architecting AI workflows, and building multi-tenant platforms that serve thousands of users. I’ve led GenAI and NLP-first product launches, like a support chatbot that scaled to 1M+ requests/month and a behavioral credit engine that boosted engagement by 2.5×.

I’m a systems thinker and roadmap executor, known for combining velocity with strategy to turn product bets into business outcomes.
